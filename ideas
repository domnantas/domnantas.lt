i need a space to
- take notes
- write about my projects for future reference
- share knowledge with others

subjective requirements
- minimal
- custom built (no frameworks, no third party CMS)
- git based
- content must be parseable
- easily editable on any device (should replace notes app on my phone)
- content is not chronological, can be updated at any time
- should be easy to see latest updates
- should not depend on any third party services

content
- text
- images
- videos
- code

things to consider:
- media processing (image resizing for srcset)
- build step will still be required, maybe github actions/netlify build is ok
- static site generator should be a separate project - how to publish it

markdown
+ parseable
+ easy to edit
- difficult to customize

html partials https://github.com/hundredrabbits/100r.co/tree/master/src/inc
+ highly customizable
+ easy to understand
+ parseable

inspiration
- https://100r.co/

instead of using c, i'll use haskell to build the site
